## Resume

**Legacy4J is a mod about nostalgia, of the old 4J Studios Minecraft Legacy Edition UI and its unique resources.**  
The main objective of this project is remake every aspect of Legacy Console Edition in 1:1 for new Java Edition versions, adding its exclusive features, such as:

* Superflat in-GUI customizer
* Tutorial World
* Animated Character (The small player in the corner)
* HUD distant from the bottom (Configurable)
* HUD Opacity config (Known issue with non-transparent blocks)
* Create the world with open LANÂ (equivalent to online game in LE)
* Selected Item Name with description
* Auto-Save Icon from Legacy Edition
* LE GUI blocks Lighting
* The GUI (obviously)
